      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am going to create a website that shows my portfolio to future employers. The portfolio is based on the profession of Civil Engineer.
         The objective is to provide professional experience as an Engineer, such as Hydraulic Design and Hydrological Modeling, 
         share some academic achievements and show some projects that I developed in the past.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Worker recruiters who need to hire a Civil Engineer, people who require engineering services for their properties or personal projects, 
        companies that want to subcontract a part of their entire project, public entities that need to develop or study the feasibility of a project and need a Civil Engineer, 
        all those who wish to know who participated and developed the projects shown in the list.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>Projects <br>
        Medlog Terminal:<br>
        The Medlog Port Terminal Project consists of the creation of a 21[Ha] surface platform which serves as storage for containers coming from the Valparaíso port terminal. 
        The development of the project included the analysis of survey points, maps and topographic data, the creation of a 3D model that represented the terrain and the large 
        projected platform that meets the requirements of the client regarding the maximum allowed slopes, the calculation of the volume of earthworks to obtain a balance between 
        the volume of cut and fill. It also included the hydrological study and hydraulic design of the interior drainage networks and a study of the flood risks resulting from massive landfilling. 
        The volume of earthwork for this project is approximately 2,000,000[m3]<br>

        Los Laureles Project:<br>
        The Los Laureles Project consists of a housing project that will allow more than 1350 low-income families to have a home which, through urbanization of land in the upper part of Valparaiso, 
        create new roads and expand the city. The engineering development consists of the elaboration of the topography based on Lidar points, hydrological study, 
        design of hydraulic networks and culverts, design of rigid pavements according to AASHTO methodology, preparation of land grading for the location of buildings in consolidated land area, 
        design of interior roads and parking areas, and flood risk analysis for the channel that has a flow of 3[m3/ s]. <br>
        Valle Pioneros Project:<br>
        The Valle Pioneros project consists of the construction of 10 residential buildings that will serve as homes for people who lost their homes in the great fire in Valparaíso. 
        The development included analysis of the topography and creation of a three-dimensional mantle for the subsequent creation of grading, estimation of earthworks, hydrological and hydraulic design,
        design of civil works such as pavements and pedestrian areas, technical reports, technical specifications, and a flood risk analysis project of the existing riverbed.
