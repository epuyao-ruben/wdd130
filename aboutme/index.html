    <h2>Ale</h2>
    <p>Hello!, I'm from Chile! and I'm trying to get a degree in software development. I like reading books, 
        learning physics, go to the gym and playing video games.</p>
    <P>I am 35 years old and have been a member 
        of the church since I was 19 years old. I served a mission in the Dominican Republic between 2010 and 2012.
        I am married and I have two kids.</P>
    <p>I have a degree in civil engineering and I am making a change in my career because 
        I want to combine programming with the development of engineering projects. 
        During my career as an engineer, I realized that I really like programming and that's why I decided to study it.</p>
